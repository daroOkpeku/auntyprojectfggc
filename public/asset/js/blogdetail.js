        Sore, The most satisfying pain.  Would you rather be covered with sweat at the gym or clothes at the beach? You have always been beautiful, now you are just deciding to be healthier, stronger, fitter and faster.
        In two weeks you will feel it, in four weeks you will see it. Don’t tell people your plans, let them see your results.
        Weight loss is a lonely battle with yourself because only you can change your body.
        You will never always be motivated; you have to learn to be disciplined. My motivation to get fit.  I refuse to be anyone’s fat ex-girlfriend.
        Nobody can do it for you; you have to do it for yourself.
        Your fitness is 100% mental; your body won’t go where your mind won’t take it.  The difference between wanting and achieving is discipline.
        I started telling myself that my will to live a healthy life is stronger than my cravings.
        Workout eat well be patient, your body will reward you.

        body:`As girls we grew up knowing that we have to work hard to achieve our dreams. We watched our mothers and aunties as they did the humongous task of juggling mommy-ing, wife-ing, housekeeping, cooking, and ultimate care-giving. And they did it with panache, with dexterity, with ease and with a smile. In most homes the daughters were quickly sent to the kitchens, taught home management and “prepared for marriageability”. They would wake in the wee hours of the morning and get the house ready for the day. They would be off to the abattoir to buy beef for the family for the month. They would be responsible for tending the younger children which most times meant baby-sitting and giving up on other fun activities. Some of us still remember how many hours it took to cook for the week or month and store in deep freezers like we were running a hotel restaurant.
        These girls were prepared for greatness.
        There is an old Mexican saying that give me a lot of joy, it says “They tried to bury us. They did not know that we were seeds!” The beauty of hard work, whether personally sought after or thrust upon one is that it reaps fruitfulness. The entire global shift to ensuring that the girl child has a better chance at life is an excellent show of repentance by a world that never gave her a voice or a chance.
        Maya Angelou said it all when she published that poem in 1978. In strong defiance she stared her challenges in the face and taunted, “You may tread me in the very dirt but still like dust I will rise!” The glass ceiling has never been so ‘decorated!’ Women entrepreneurs and intra-preneurs alike have emerged as thought leaders, inventors, political giants, creative gurus, and fantastic wives and mothers.
        “….. to build and not break down, bury quarrels in the ground!”
        Today, that girl child is a hydra-headed monster! A giant that stops at nothing to achieve everything that is due her. She has taken the best of her mother and aunties and combined it with the realities of her opportunities today and has emerged as an unstoppable force. That is our story. That is our dream. That is our focus.
        We celebrate as our school, our successes that have trailed us in our various endeavors through school(s) and home upbringing. We celebrate even the challenges that we face in our quest for the excellence we sought after. We join hands with the young and the old fusing generations of this culture of resilience. In oneness we encourage a sisterhood that walks and works together, keeping the dream alive.

        What do I mean?
        Discover your passion! Fulfil your purpose! Find your Destiny!!!
        And so on…
        How?!!
        Why?!!
        I’ll keep it simple.
        Your PURPOSE on this planet is to glory God and He gives you the tools in form of gifts that would enable you do to this
        Any passion or purpose that doesn’t do this is a distraction and an exercise in self-aggrandizement! The general idea is for you to be a blessing to humanity while living out your own life. You have been gifted so it’s not your sole effort. The giver of the gift has also fashioned it in such a way that you can multiply the gift and be so productive that you are also able to have a very comfortable life while you’re at it. The catch is that God our Father who IS the giver, will hold you and I accountable for the gifts and the use to which we have put them…
        Are you accountable?!!
        Now, to the gurus...
        What if you have multiplied passion and multiplied potentials
        Yes? After all, to some He gave 5 talents…
        Hmm! (I love that one) but we will hold on for now…
        Bottom line, seek God’s direction, yes some people are equipped to help you along the way but make sure you enjoy the journey.
        Don’t obsess about discovering purpose when it is right there already!!!
        Remember, it is a GIFT
        Blessings.

        body:`As the popular adage goes “he who fails to plan, plans to fail” to this effect planning your family is a necessary ingredient if the family must succeed. As mothers we are expected to sit down and plan; even planning for the number of children to have based on your financial capacity.
        For instance, sending a child to a school above your income shows you haven’t planned. Do not rent apartment s you cannot afford as this puts you and your spouse under stress.
        We as mothers must understand that family has to gradually grow to where they ought to be. Life is in phases! The reason for failure in the family is taking action without planning.
        Steps to effective planning include:
        •	Write down your plan for the future
        •	Have a picture of greatness for the future
        •	Depend on the divine guidance of the Holy Spirit
        •	Separate yourself from evil things, resources and friends that waste your energy
        •	Avoid procrastination and run with your plan diligently
