Our Sisters are geographically dispersed across different cities/provinces - Toronto, Vaughan, Mississauga, Ajax, Caledon, Milton, Oakville, Waterloo, Kitchener, Hamilton, North York, Windsor, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton, St John’s NL, Halifax and Vancouver, British Columbia.
        The idea for the chapter was birthed in 2011 as members began to reconnect on Facebook. A Facebook group was created named, “FGGC Owerri – GTA Canada Reunion” as members were from Greater Toronto Area (GTA) only at the time. The inaugural meeting was held on July 1, 2012 at Scarborough, Ontario which was hosted by Basirat Naphew who also started our Facebook forum. On July 24th, 2016, our current VP Canada Adaeze Nwosu nee Ononye started a WhatsApp Group to reignite interest in the chapter and foster sisterhood.
        Our activities include; quarterly general meetings held virtually and in-person for Sisters in the GTA meetup at a member’s house), charity donations for shelters, family and friends summer picnics in the Toronto area, Sisters in Ottawa, Calgary and some other provinces do occasional meetups, Sisters seminars, Christmas dinner/party across various cities/provinces, visits to sisters (bereavement, childbirth, etc.) and sisters’ birthday shout-outs as we love to celebrate ourselves.
        Our Mission is to maintain and strengthen the bond of sisterhood amongst ourselves here in Canada and support our alma mater and each other. We do this by contributing to national projects and paying our national dues. We coordinate fundraising drives to help members who may be experiencing financial difficulties.
        We are growing in strength and numbers and continue fostering love and unity.
        We are also looking forward to hosting the next US/ Canada reunion in August 2024!

        Living in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex can be challenging when it comes to meetings and keeping in touch. Some sisters work weekdays, some weekends, some both. However, true to our vision to “genuinely be there for one another”, we continue to support each other, from attending services of songs to graduations, thanksgivings, even Christmas parties, and potlucks. Our social platforms have also helped us bridge the gap. We continually look for and implement ways to make each other’s’ lives easier and better as a family “away from home”.  Like a poet once wrote, "...Leaving behind nights of terror and fear... Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear... Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, just like hopes springing high, still We’ll rise!"

        The Chapter started with a very few old girls, commissioned by Mrs. Urenna Iheme, her executive and a host of other beautiful sisters who came through to make sure this Chapter was up and running even via zoom.
        An executive was elected to oversee the affairs of the Chapter. Asaba Chapter has a few members registered being that the Chapter is still a very young one nonetheless the core of sisterhood is alive therein.
        Asaba Chapter has a WhatsApp group, where members discuss and pass information concerning the welfare of each other and also promote their businesses, and share the fun, joy, peace and love of sisterhood.
        We also meet quarterly in our various homes to get to know our families better in a fulfilled atmosphere.

        about:`FGGC Owerri Canada Chapter currently has about 57 members. Our Sisters are geographically dispersed across different cities/provinces - Toronto, Vaughan, Mississauga, Ajax, Caledon, Milton, Oakville, Waterloo, Kitchener, Hamilton, North York, Windsor, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton, St John’s NL, Halifax and Vancouver, British Columbia.
        The idea for the chapter was birthed in 2011 as members began to reconnect on Facebook. A Facebook group was created named, “FGGC Owerri – GTA Canada Reunion” as members were from Greater Toronto Area (GTA) only at the time. The inaugural meeting was held on July 1, 2012 at Scarborough, Ontario which was hosted by Basirat Naphew who also started our Facebook forum. On July 24th, 2016, our current VP Canada Adaeze Nwosu nee Ononye started a WhatsApp Group to reignite interest in the chapter and foster sisterhood.
        Our activities include; quarterly general meetings held virtually and in-person for Sisters in the GTA meetup at a member’s house), charity donations for shelters, family and friends summer picnics in the Toronto area, Sisters in Ottawa, Calgary and some other provinces do occasional meetups, Sisters seminars, Christmas dinner/party across various cities/provinces, visits to sisters (bereavement, childbirth, etc.) and sisters’ birthday shout-outs as we love to celebrate ourselves.
        Our Mission is to maintain and strengthen the bond of sisterhood amongst ourselves here in Canada and support our alma mater and each other. We do this by contributing to national projects and paying our national dues. We coordinate fundraising drives to help members who may be experiencing financial difficulties.
        We are growing in strength and numbers and continue fostering love and unity.
        We are also looking forward to hosting the next US/ Canada reunion in August 2024!
